## Profile Overview

AI Engineer looking to grow in a dynamic, professional environment focused on advanced AI. Passionate about building intelligent systems and solving complex problems through data-driven solutions.

## Experience

*   **Tekatech, Programming and Robotics Instructor** (04/2024 – 10/2024)
    *   Instruct and mentor students in robotics, focusing on hands-on programming, applications, mechanical design, and automation system. Participate in international competitions.

## Education

*   **Information Technology Institute (ITI), (MCIT) Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, AI Track, Mansoura Branch** (10/2024 – present)
    *   9-Month Diploma
*   **Mansoura University** (2017 – 2022)
    *   Bachelor in Mechatronics Engineering
    *   Graduated from Faculty of Engineering, Mechatronics department with a 3.3 GPA (Very Good)

## Projects

*   **Transformer Implementation with Deployment**
    *   Implemented a Transformer model from scratch in PyTorch for educational purposes. Includes multi-head attention, positional encoding, and support for classification/regression. Features attention visualization with Streamlit for hands-on experimentation.
*   **Lung CT-Scan Segmentation**
    *   Developed a lung CT scan segmentation model using TensorFlow and U-Net architecture. The model detects lung regions by applying convolutional layers, skip connections, and upsampling for precise segmentation. Trained on labeled CT scan datasets, achieving accurate segmentation for medical image analysis.
*   **Hate Speech Classification**
    *   Built a hate speech classifier using NLP and machine learning. Preprocessed text, applied TF-IDF or embeddings, and trained models like Logistic Regression or BERT. Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score. Supports automated content moderation.
*   **Text Analysis and Clustering**
    *   Unsupervised learning is used to cluster similar text data. The text is preprocessed using techniques like tokenization and stopword removal. It is then converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or embeddings. Clustering is performed using models like K-Means, with evaluation via silhouette scores and a modular, well-logged pipeline.
*   **Sign Language Translator**
    *   Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV for data collection and preprocessing. Trained a TensorFlow/Keras model to classify sign language gestures, optionally using a CNN architecture. The system uses a webcam for live detection and translates gestures into text output.
*   **Self-Driving Robot, Hand Gesture detector(Graduation Project: Assistant Robot)**
    *   Built an assistant robot that tracks its owner using hand gestures, localization, and obstacle avoidance. Hand gestures are detected in real-time using CVzone’s HandTrackingModule with five predefined commands. Obstacle avoidance is handled by a YOLOX model fine-tuned on 80 COCO classes. These components enable the robot to follow its owner while navigating safely around obstacles.
